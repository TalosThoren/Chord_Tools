Description: 

	The Chord Tools project shows the triads in each key
signature used in modern western music. Chord Tools is for use when 
studying the fundamentals of music theory. The Chord Tools will
be used later in conjunction with LaTeX to create an educational
document analyzing the chords and the relationships between key
signatures.
